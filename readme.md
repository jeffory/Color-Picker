# Color Picker (For Sublime Text 2)

So this is a simple plugin to pull up the Windows color picker, born out of frustration for not having one built-in.

It is quite hackish and there are surely better ways on doing it, so feel free to make suggestions.

Looking into Linux to see if there is a way of getting the color picker working on that as well.

Also it has only been tested on Windows 7 64-bit so far.
